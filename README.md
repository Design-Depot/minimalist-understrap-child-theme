# minimalist-understrap-childp-theme
A very minimalist child theme for UnderStrap. Just the bare necessities to get it working and a file structure.

You can download UnderStrap through github or their website. Though it's not required. WP will download the parent theme automatically when you upload this theme. 

Edit the file structure if you want, of just leave it as it is and start developing.
